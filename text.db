I don't dance, but I box my frustrations out. Boxing is controlled, it's calculated, it's disciplined. There's structure and everyone comes at the same 6 moves, with the same basic form. And then, once you've mastered that. Comes the creativity. Fuck it all. I used to dance, I danced as a kid freely, and without care. But then I got good, and then dance became competitive, it became a sport. I still dance, but I've had to rediscover my love for it in a different way. Fuck. I miss dancing.
